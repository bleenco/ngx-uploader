Please do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. For general support questions we recommend to seek for help at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), we recommend to use `ngx-uploader` tag. We are actively maintaining the 4.x branch, both 2.x and 3.x branches were outdated and removed.

**This module has been rewritten with the version `3.0.0`.**
